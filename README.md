# Memory Game Project

## What is the Memory Game
This is a card matching game built to test player's memory. There's a deck of cards with different symbols faced down. 

## How to Play
The deck is made up of 8 pairs of different cards, each with different symols on them. The cards are aranged randomly on the grid with the symbol not showing up. Click on two hidden cards at a time to locate the matching pair. Each turn, one card is flipped over to reveal its underlying symbol; then a second card is flipped, if the cards are matched, both cards stay flipped over; if the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched and are flipped over.
